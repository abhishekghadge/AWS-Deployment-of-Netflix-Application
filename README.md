Aws DevOps Deployment 

AWS DevOps involves using a set of tools and practices to streamline the development, deployment, and operation of applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. Here's a brief explanation along with some common tools:

CodeCommit: This is a source control service provided by AWS, similar to GitHub. Developers use it to store and manage their code.

CodeBuild: This service automatically compiles source code, runs tests, and produces ready-to-deploy software packages.

CodeDeploy: It automates the deployment of applications to AWS infrastructure, making the process faster, more reliable, and repeatable.

CodePipeline: This tool orchestrates the different stages of the software release process, from source code changes to deployment, allowing for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): It provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Developers can deploy applications on virtual servers known as instances.

Lambda: AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It's great for building serverless applications, where you only pay for the compute time you consume.

CloudFormation: This tool allows you to define your AWS infrastructure as code using a simple text file. You can then provision and manage AWS resources in an automated and repeatable way.

Elastic Beanstalk: It's a service for deploying and managing applications in the AWS cloud without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. It supports various programming languages and platforms.

These tools help teams collaborate more effectively, automate repetitive tasks, and deliver high-quality software faster and more reliably. They're essential for practicing DevOps principles on the AWS platform
